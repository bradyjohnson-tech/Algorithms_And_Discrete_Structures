# The provided code is a classic example of a loop that halves the input n at each iteration until n becomes less than or equal to 1.
# In terms of time complexity or T(n), this is characterized as O(log n), specifically O(log n) to the base 2, because we are continuously dividing n by 2 in each iteration.
# In this case, log n refers to the number of steps/iterations required to reduce n to 1 using division by 2.
# In summary, the time complexity T(n) of the given code is O(log n) to the base 2.
